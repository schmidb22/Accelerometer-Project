#Accelerometer Project üìê

##System Overview

###Transducer and Input
The input to the system is the voltage signal received by the transducer. The transducer used in this project is an accelerometer. An accelerometer is a device that senses acceleration. An application of this device is the use as a tilt sensor, where it converts the angle it is held at to a voltage signal. The accelerometer requires an input of 3.3V in order to run, and outputs the measured angle as a voltage signal. The accelerometer used in our design is capable of measuring acceleration in three dimensions; however, for the purpose of this project only one dimension was used as input. The accelerometer used is ADXL337, it uses capacitance in order to convert the physical changes into an electrical signal. A capacitor is two parallel plates that are separated by an insulator which is capable of storing electric charge. This is used in the accelerometer because when an accelerative force moves one of the parallel plates, it changes the capacitance which can then be converted into voltage.

###Hardware
The hardware used in the project is the EsduinoXtreme, which is a type of microcontroller. A microcontroller is a small computer used for a single integrated circuit. They are often used in automatically controlled products and devices. The Esduino contains an integrated processor (CPU), memory, input/output peripherals, an analog to digital converter, and serial communication capabilities. The Esduino was chosen as the hardware for this project because it contains all of the required components of the project.

The EsduinoXtreme contains an 8MHz crystal, a bus speed of 24MHz and a 1MHz internal oscillator. It operates at either 5V or 3.3V, for this project our device operated at 3.3V because that was the voltage required by the accelerometer. The Esduino has three different types of memory, it can store 240K flash, 4K EEPROM and 11K RAM. Flash memory is non-volatile, random access memory. EEPROM is similar to flash; however, it is capable of erasing a single byte of memory, whereas flash memory can only erase a sector of memory at a time. RAM stands for random access memory, and it is faster than flash and EEPROM. RAM is volatile memory which means it is not permanent, and when the device is turned off the RAM loses all of its data.

The Esduino contains built in 12-bit analog to digital conversion capability. The Esduino contain 6 ADC channels, and this project used channel 6 at a resolution of 12. The Esduino can be programmed using several programs: C, assembly and BASIC. For this project, the Esduino was programmed using C in CodeWarrior. An EsduinoXtreme can be purchased for approximately $85 CAD.

###Program
The Esduino was programmed using CodeWarrior in C. The purpose of the program was to stop and start the code using a push button, switch between display modes, and output to a PC using serial communication. The program began by defining the necessary variables, configuring input and output, setting the baud rate, setting serial communication, and initializing the functions. There were five functions used in this program: one to set the E-clock, one for a delay, and three for the different display modes.

The function offmode() was used when the program was turned off, and it turned all the LEDs off by assigning the output ports to low. In mode1(), the outputted data was represented in binary coded decimal where the first four LEDs represented most significant digit of the angle, the next four LEDs represent the least significant digit of the angle, and the last LED is ignored. This was done by taking the binary value of the angle and using a mask to isolate the values required to output for the least significant and most significant digit of the angle. The values were then bitwise shifted to correspond with the required pins for output. In mode2(), the outputted data was represented by a linear bar in increasing ten-degree increments. This was accomplished by using nine if statements and setting the corresponding LEDs for the range that the angle fell into. These different modes were controlled in the program using different conditions.
